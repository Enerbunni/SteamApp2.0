# Steam App 
Steam Stats is a cross platform mobile app I made with React Native and Native Base. It works by first asking the user to enter in their steamID, then the app will load in statistics like total hours plays, current account value, and games owned as some examples. 
The data is pulled from the pulled from Steam's API and is cached being
periodically updated. The app also includes the ability to toggle light and dark mode. I had the idea for this app when seeing a similar website like steamDB and wanting an easy way to show of my steam account to friends and coworkers on my phone. The part
that was the proudest of was setting up a reverse proxy using AWS. This allowed me
to keep my private API key a secret and out of my source code. The project was also a great chance for me to explore the app making process and learn a framework like
React Native. If I keep working on this project I'll want to go through the process of publishing to the app stores.
